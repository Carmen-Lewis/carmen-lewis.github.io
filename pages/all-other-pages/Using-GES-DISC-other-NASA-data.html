        <h1>Using GES DISC & other NASA data</h1>
        <p>Unknown to some, but accessing satellite data has never been easier (in theory). It is a most useful
            source of data, however, learning the lay of the land is time-consuming and, quite frankly,
            frustrating. One of the main issues is knowing where to look for data and upon observing the amount
            of data available, where to start.</p>

        <p>NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program includes twelve Distributed Active Archive Centers
            (DAACs) that provides access to oceanography, socioeconomic, atmospheric, hydrology and geological
            data. The objective of this article (and website) is energy meteorology, so the two DAACs we will
            look at is ASDC (Atmospheric Science Data Center) and GES DISC (Goddard Earth Sciences Data and
            Information Services Center). Although other remote retrieval sources exist such as Copernicus Space
            Component Data Access system (CSCDA), I have found that NASA data includes greater spatial, temporal
            and parameter options, and often includes datasets from Copernicus, for example.</p>

        <p>In this article, we'll explore the types of data and how to filter through the many options,
            specifically in GES DISC. We'll also have a look at the differences in file hierarchy and how to
            quickly view the selected data set. In part II (and maybe even part III) of this article series,
            I'll take you through the steps of plotting satellite data with Python in meaningful ways.</p>

        <h2>Finding the right data (in the right way)</h2>
        <p>There are several options for searching data in GES DISC. We can simply search specific terminology
            such as “carbon dioxide” or “CO2” which will both show the same 143 datasets. We can further specify
            a date range (in UTC) and limit our search to a bounding box of specific coordinates. The last
            search parameter will not significantly decrease the number of datasets provided but is a crucial
            parameter when we have selected a specific dataset.</p>

        <p>The second option is searching by category (which includes terms such as atmospheric chemistry,
            clouds, and precipitation), either after or before our initial search of “CO2”. We can also search
            by category (or subject) and then by measurement (which includes terms such as absorption, carbon
            dioxide, surface temperature). We can also search by source, processing level, project, temporal
            resolution, and spatial resolution.</p>

        <p>We can also be more specific, i.e. are we looking for carbon dioxide surface concentrations, total
            column abundance, or vertical profile (I will elaborate on these subjects in another post). A good
            place to start would be to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>download a single file from the selected dataset and have a quick
                look at it, or</li>
            <li>read the dataset documentation (which you will have to do eventually).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Let's select the dataset AIRS/Aqua L2 Support Retrieval (AIRS-only) V006 (AIRS2SUP 006). Clicking on
            the title will take us to a page that summarises the dataset (also called product), supplies
            documentation on the quality of the data, and several ways in which to access the data. The data
            access options are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>online archive,</li>
            <li>Earthdata search,</li>
            <li>Simple Subset Wizard (SSW),</li>
            <li>OPeNDAP, and</li>
            <li>GES DISC's “Subset/Get Data”.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The online archive is basically an archive with several directories containing data from the
            specific set. It is ideal for bulk downloads via FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and wget - I won't be
            getting into this data access options, but GES DISC has a how-to with wget. I would not recommend
            this option if you are still only exploring datasets. OPeNDAP is similar to the online archive.</p>

        <p>The Earthdata search supplies a more visual platform for searching within a subset (also known as
            granule). Due to the separation of spatial and temporal search parameters, it could result in a
            significant amount of scrolling to find the correct granule. However, if you would like an aesthetic
            experience, this option could work for you.</p>

        <p>The Simple Subset Wizard (SSW) really is a simple way to narrow down your search within a dataset.
            You have the option of selecting a data set keyword (which would be (AIRS2SUP 006) in this case and
            usually auto-completed in navigation from the SSW button on the product page), a date range and a
            spatial bounding box that you can either complete with coordinates or via a map.</p>

        <p>Finally, we have the Subset/Get Data option, which is very similar to the Simple Subset Wizard. I
            have found this the most intuitive way to search for, and download subsets. You will see a pop-up
            window, with options to change the download method, date range, (spatial) region, and in some cases
            the file format. You can also see the estimated size of the results, which are often humungous
            before refining the subset search.</p>
